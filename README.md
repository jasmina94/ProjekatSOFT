# Idea 

**OCR** (Optical Character Recognition) is process of converting different type of documents, scanned paper documents, PDFs, images into editable and searchable data.
This technology is very popular and in widespread usage. It can recognize characters, words and sentences without making many mistakes. Although, documents containing images besides text may be not converted completley. 

#Motivation

In the running world there is a growing demand for software systems to recognize characters in computer system when information is scanned through paper document. The question is how to find valuable data from all those information and store it. The concept of storing the contents of paper documents in computer storage place and then reading and searching content is called _document processing_.
Motivation for this project is to make personal snipping tool in the role of _online newspaper reader_. Processing of online document content has challanges. Detect language, separate text from other information (images) and read it.
This project is mainly a research of [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr) engine and its 
[wrapper](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract) for .NET  framework.
